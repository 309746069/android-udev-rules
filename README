These rules refer to

and include many suggestions from the Archlinux and Github Community

If you're developing on Ubuntu Linux, you need to add a udev rules file that contains a USB configuration for each type of device you want to use for development. In the rules file, each device manufacturer is identified by a unique vendor ID, as specified by the ATTR{idVendor} property. For a list of vendor IDs, see USB Vendor IDs, below. To set up device detection on Ubuntu Linux:
Log in as root and create this file: /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules.
Use this format to add each vendor to the file:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev" 

In this example, the vendor ID is for HTC. 
The MODE assignment specifies read/write permissions, and GROUP defines which Unix group owns the device node.
Note: The rule syntax may vary slightly depending on your environment. Consult the udev documentation for your system as needed. For an overview of rule syntax, see this guide to writing udev rules. 
please refer to 51-android.rules in [ubuntu directory](ubuntu)
Now execute:
chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules

Try group plugdev rather than plugindev. Then restart udev:
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo service udev restart

Add plugdev to <ubuntuloginid>
sudo useradd -G plugdev <ubuntuloginid>
